How to Compile and run this program


get into eustis and navigate to the folder where all of the files are uploaded 



enter this command to compile it 
>> gcc -o <whatever the fuck you want to name it> vm.c lex.c parser.c main.c 

assuming that we named it compiled
>> gcc -o compiled vm.c lex.c parser.c main.c 

after it compiles then you run cases as such 

>> ./compiled <input file name> <output file name>

it will run and in doing so generate some extra text files it uses to push things through one program to the next. 

this is going to read in the raw code,
put it through the lexer,
push the lexemes to the parser to be made into code, 
later on I will work on getting that code to run and do the stuff it is supposed to but that is for the next assignment.
